# Azure-Platform

This repository contains a collection of hands‑on Azure labs that I’m creating to deepen my understanding of cloud services, administration, and security. While completing my Cybersecurity and Network Technology diploma, I gained exposure to core Azure concepts, but there were many areas I didn’t have the chance to fully explore. These labs are my way of expanding that foundation and developing real, practical cloud experience.
